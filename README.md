# AccessNow MTL

## Project Type
Academic Web Application Project

## Overview
AccessNow MTL is an academic web project developed as part of my software engineering studies.
The objective of this project is to design, structure, and document a real-world web application
that helps users in Montreal identify and access essential public and community services
based on their situation.

This project focuses on software architecture, documentation, and progressive development.

## Problem Statement
In Montreal, many individuals such as students, newcomers, and residents face difficulties
finding the appropriate service when dealing with housing, healthcare, administrative,
or social issues. Information is often scattered, unclear, or difficult to access.

AccessNow MTL aims to provide a structured and guided approach to help users
navigate these services efficiently.
